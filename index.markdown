<p style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: #444; margin-top: 1em;">
Our curriculum is enriched with specialized courses in celestial mechanics, cosmology, stellar structure and evolution, galactic and extragalactic astronomy, and observational techniques. Students are also introduced to practical skills such as telescope handling, astronomical image processing, and Python-based data analysis ‚Äî equipping them with both scientific literacy and technical fluency.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: #444;">
The program emphasizes experiential learning through workshops, sky-gazing events, lecture series, and educational expeditions to leading national facilities like <strong>ARIES, IUCAA, PRL</strong>, and the <strong>Devasthal Optical Telescope</strong>. These immersive experiences allow students to witness real-world research operations, interact with professional scientists, and gain hands-on exposure to observatory instrumentation and data workflows.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: #444;">
Backed by a dedicated and research-active faculty, our students are mentored to explore independent research ideas and pursue opportunities in internships, fellowships, and higher education. We foster a collaborative academic environment where interdisciplinary curiosity is celebrated and nurtured.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: #444;">
Whether you aspire to decode the mysteries of black holes, contribute to space missions, or simply deepen your understanding of the cosmos ‚Äî our <strong>Astronomy & Astrophysics program at UPES</strong> is your gateway to the universe.
